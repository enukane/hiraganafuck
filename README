hiraganafuck

-- what is this? --
hiraganafuck converts "hiragana" strings to brainfuck source codes.
In the process, hiraganafuck uses tables of transition probabilities of "hiragana" and "brainfuck"
As a language, converted in hiragana, we can find some tendency in the stream of hiraganas in japanese sentences.
And this idea can be also apliable for brainfuck source code; that consisted of 8 characters.

The tables of transistion probabilities shows "what characters can come next?".
hiraganafuck uses this tables to dynamically change the bindings between "hiragana character" and "function" that it represents/
